# useContext() Hook 
<p>
The useContext hook allows you to pass data down to nested components in your component tree without having to manually pass props through each level. It's a real time-saver, especially in larger applications where prop drilling can become cumbersome.

<p>In our example, we start by creating a UserContext using the createContext function. This context will hold the user data that we want to share across components.</p>
